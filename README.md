Program Description:
This program is an implementation of a Course Review System with an easy to use GUI. The program will allow students to 
login in with a username and password, write course reviews for UVA courses, see reviews for UVA courses, and generate 
an output JSON file of all UVA courses. The program is divided into three layers, the Business, Data and Presentation, for 
ease of use, design and maintainability.
